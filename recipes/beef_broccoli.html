            1 tsp fresh ginger, grated (loosely packed)
        </li>
        <li>
            2 tsp garlic, grated (from 3 cloves)
        </li>
        <li>
            6 tbsp soy sauce
        </li>
        <li>
            3 tbsp packed light brown sugar
        </li>
        <li>
            1 1/2 tbsp corn starch
        </li>
        <li>
            1/4 tsp black pepper
        </li>
        <li>
            2 tbsp sesame oil
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Prep:</strong> Start cooking white rice first so it's ready when the stir fry is done.
            Cover and freeze steak 30 minutes for easier slicing.
        </li>
        <li>
            Combine all stir fry sauce ingredients in a bowl, stir well to dissolve the
            sugar, and set aside.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place a large skillet over medium heat and add 1 tbsp oil.  Add broccoli florets
            and sauté 4-5 minutes, partially covered with lid, stirring or tossing several
            times until broccoli is bright green and crisp-tender then remove from pan. 
            ip: If you prefer softer broccoli, add 2 tbsp water before covering with the lid
            and it will steam cook the broccoli.
        </li>
        <li>
            Increase heat to high heat and add 1 tbsp oil. Add beef in a single layer and sauté
            2 minutes per side or just until cooked through. Quickly pull out a piece to test
            for doneness.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add the sauce, reduce heat to medium/low and simmer 3-4 minutes. It will thicken. Add
            broccoli and stir to combine. Stir in 1-2 tbsp water to thin the sauce if desired.
            Serve over white rice.
        </li>
    </ol>
