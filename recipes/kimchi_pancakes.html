        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Hot, spicy, crispy, a little sweet, a little sour, and a little salty.
            Kimchi pancakes are not only a great snack, but they also go well with
            rice as a side dish, and is great in lunchboxes in place of plain kimchi.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                1/2 pound well-fermented napa cabbage kimchi, chopped into small pieces,
                plus 2 tablespoons of the brine
            </li>
            <li>
                3 scallions, chopped
            </li>
            <li>
                1/2 teaspoon sugar
            </li>
            <li>
                1/2 cup all-purpose flour
            </li>
            <li>
                1/2 cup water
            </li>
            <li>
                4 tablespoons vegetable oil
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Combine the kimchi, kimchi brine, scallions, sugar, flour, and water in
                a medium bowl and mix well with a spoon.
            </li>
            <li>
                Heat a 12-inch nonstick skillet over medium heat. (If you don't have a
                12-inch skillet, use a smaller skillet to make 2 pancakes.)
            </li>
            <li>
                Add 2 tablespoons of the vegetable oil and swirl to coat the bottom of
                the pan.
            </li>
            <li>
                Pour the batter into the pan and spread it with the back of a spoon or
                a spatula to make a large circle.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook until the bottom is golden brown and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Carefully turn the pancake over. Drizzle the remaining 2 tablespoons
                oil around the edges of the skillet, then lift the pancake with a
                thin spatula to allow the oil to run underneath and tilt the pan to
                spread it evenly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Cook until the bottom of the pancake is light golden brown and crisp,
                3 to 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Flip it one more time and cook for another minute.
            </li>
            <li>
                Slide onto a large serving platter and serve immediately.
            </li>
        </ol>
