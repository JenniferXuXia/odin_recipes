    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        A perfect combination of sweet, tart, and savory, the apple omelette
        can be as simple as scrambling two key ingredients, but is always an
        unexpected delight.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 egg, whisked</li>
        <li>1 apple, minced</li>
        <li>Cinammon</li>
        <li>Sugar</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            After mincing the apple and whisking the egg, season each with
            cinnamon and sugar to taste. Sprinkle some salt into the egg as
            well.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat up olive oil in the pan and add in the apple slices. Then,
            sautee the apple for 3-5 minutes until the apple is soft.
        </li>
        <li>
            Make sure the apple is spread out evenly, then pour the whisked egg
            evenly over the pan. Cook them together until the egg is at desired
            doneness.
        </li>
    </ol>
